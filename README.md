# ULTRAHYPRTHEME
ULTRAKILL P-2 Theme for Hyprland

## Prerequisites
You have to have archlinux. Why? Too lazy to add support to detect the package manager of choice.
You have to have `hyprland`, `python3` and `git` installed.
The extra packages such as waybar, fastfetch and hyprpaper will get installed by the install script.

## Installation
First of all, clone this repository by running:
`git clone https://github.com/GAMINGNOOBdev/uk_p2_hypr_theme`

After that you can change into the cloned repository and run the install script:
```bash

cd uk_p2_hypr_theme
python3 install.py

```
