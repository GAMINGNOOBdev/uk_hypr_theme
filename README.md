## Prerequisites
You have to have archlinux. Why? Too lazy to add support to detect the package manager of choice.
You have to have `yay`, `python3` and `git` installed.
The extra packages such as hyprland, waybar, fastfetch, hyprpaper and so on will get installed by the install shell script.

## Installation
First of all, clone this repository by running:
`git clone https://github.com/GAMINGNOOBdev/uk_hypr_theme`

After that you can change into the cloned repository and run the install scripts:
> [!NOTE]
> You have to run the `install_packages.sh` file first before running the python script!!!
```bash

cd uk_hypr_theme
bash install_packages.sh
python3 install.py
cd ..

```

Now...
